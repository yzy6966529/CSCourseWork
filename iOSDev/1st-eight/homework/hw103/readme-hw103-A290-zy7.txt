Texting Respository

1. I have already finished all requirements of Homework 103. \
2. Both view controller can obtain data through the same data model which is created in appDelegate. Which means they share the data. \
3. In the second view, you can edit questions and answers in the database, and update new edition to the database. In the first view you can see the change of these questions and answers.\
4. I add a variable currentEditingIndex to different from currentQuestionIndex\
5. I can understand obtain a reference to the AppDelegate.\
I can not understand why the sentence make up like this:UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as? AppDelegate.\
Why there is a as after UIApplication.sharedApplication()? What does it mean?}
