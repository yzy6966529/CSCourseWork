1. I am working individually
2. Complete sign in/log in user interface. Implement all functionality of sign in and log in. I set up all basic sets of Firebase(Database). It means I can manage all user sign in and log in behavior in Firebase. Right now, App can handle all basic errors when the user log in and sign up, and save user information to database when sign in successfully. 

3. Refference: chat app is built based on Firbase Chat App https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7m_F27cUHY&list=PLZhNP5qJ2IA0ZamF_MDzvmb3bNMv-mLt5
Because chat part and database part are very difficult for me, so I will build those parts in my app based on the tutorial app which I referenced. 

Thank you
