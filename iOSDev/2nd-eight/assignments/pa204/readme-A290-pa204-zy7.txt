Basic chat view has been complete. After press send button, the message will be send to database. And another user’s app will retrieve those messages and show it in chat view. I used observed method to keep tracking the changing of message in database.3. implement contact list, and remove the current user from list.4. Refference: chat app is built based on Firbase Chat App https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7m_F27cUHY&list=PLZhNP5qJ2IA0ZamF_MDzvmb3bNMv-mLt5Because chat part and database part are very difficult for me, so I will build my app based on the tutorial which I referenced.
